# EEG-fMRI

There is a project of prediction subcortical BOLD signal from concurrent EEG using machine learning

Inspired by https://github.com/laughinghuman/EEG_fMRI


- Make_prediction.ipynb - It is the main file. You download data, generate dataset, train Ridge loss and make prediction on test data
